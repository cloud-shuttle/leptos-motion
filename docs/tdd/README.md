# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Guide

## TDD Process
1. **Red**: Write a failing test first
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat**: Continue the cycle for each feature

## TDD Checklist
- [ ] Write failing test first (Red)
- [ ] Ensure test fails for the right reason
- [ ] Write minimal code to pass test (Green)
- [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
- [ ] Review test coverage and quality

## Examples
